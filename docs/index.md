# Maven Snippet Library

Maven is a powerful build tool. Yet the many configuration options offered are often overwhelming to newcomers. Even setting up a simple ```Hello, World!``` project that *just works* can be at first a little tedious.

## About this Page

This web page hosts a step by step guide, that takes you from a minimal valid configuration to advanced features, such as enforced checkstyle and documentation rules to ensure a minimum of code quality. All the snippets on this page are taken from my own projects, they have been **tested and proven** over the past years.
