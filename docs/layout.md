Folder layout

![folderlayout](../captures/folderlayout.png)


 * The items marked in red are mandated by maven. This structure has to be exactly like above.
 * The items marked blue are your group id. Of course you should not use my id "eu/kartoffelquadrat", but something that represents your group, e.g. comp361/hexanomeXX
 * The item marked yellow is your artifactid. That one describes your software. It should be splendorclient.
