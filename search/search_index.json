The habit of dragging needed libraries at random points graphically into your IDE unfortunately conceals the actual complexity of code dependencies. Motivation While the drag and drop approach might work for a single developer, it is not a reliable approach for fast workstation setup or even scenarios where not graphical access to the code exists (compiling on a server via SSH). The Classpath What actually happens when you try to compile a piece of software that calls a library is that the java compiler sets out for journey to localize the library you are referring to. Unfortunately just writing the import statement, or calling a library is insufficient. What the compiler actually needs is a classpath reference. (The classpath is a bit like the PATH variable on your operating system. It indexes all the software installed, only in this case specifically for java libraries) In principle you could manually download all libraries your project needs and manually alter the classpath every time you compile or run your software. When you drag and drop a library jar file on your IDE that actually happens implicitly. The problem is that this only solves the issue for the very machine you are working on, not for any other developer who clones your project. This is once more where maven comes to rescue. Maven has a dedicated part in the pom.xml file to indicate all dependencies textually. Since the pom.xml resides alongside the sources of your project, everyone who want to work with your project automatically gets all it's dependencies, store between the <dependencies>...</dependencies> tags. Mavens Dependency Model The Maven pom.xml only stores a unique description of your dependencies, not the referenced libraries themselves. Luckily! Otherwise your repository would rapidly exceed a tolerable size. A dependency entry might look like this: <dependency> <groupId> commons-io </groupId> <artifactId> commons-io </artifactId> <version> 2.11.0 </version> </dependency> When Maven find the above entry it will run the following procedure: Check if you already have the referenced dependency locally (maven has a local buffer in your homedirectory, .m2 folder) If not yet found locally, maven contacts the official library servers and downloads the jar for you. It then stores it in your local buffer, so things are faster next time. Once the dependency is resolved, Maven adds the locally downloaded artifact to your CLASSPATH. This means starting now, any reference from code can be correctly resolved. The great thing about this procedure is: If your pom.xml evolves, all develeopers have automatically the full list of all dependencies, and the right versions - without a single mouse click in IDE menus. It just works! Reliably. Finding Libraries At this point you might wonder how on earth you are supposed to figure out the correct dependency entry for the library you need. Luckily this has been made very simple for you. If e.g. you are looking for the Apache Commons IO library, to conveniently load files from disk you can simply: Visit the maven central: https://mvnrepository.com/ Search for the needed artifact: Apache Commons IO Click the version number: Usually you want the most recent one Copy and paste the dependency block into your pom.xml <dependency> <groupId> commons-io </groupId> <artifactId> commons-io </artifactId> <version> 2.11.0 </version> </dependency>","title":"Dependency Management"},{"location":"dependencies/#compile-time-dependencies","text":"Most programmers at first are puzzled by the complexity of library integration.

While this may work for some toy examples or little scripting tools, hacked in a day, bigger software projects often have a long list of requirements and likewise are expected to compile and run reliable no matter to platform or developer cloning the project. This is where maven enters the game. Maven replaces drag and click based project configuration where a developer sets up their project via IDE menus, by a central xml textual description, the `pom.xml . Files and Folders The root of a maven project should roughly look like this: Before we go into the details, not that there are two important entires at root level: pom.xml which contains all project configuration. Almost everything presented on this webpage are snippets that extend this file. A src folder, all your source code, tests, even resources go somewhere into that folder. Depending on which configurations you add to your pom.xml you might have addition content on top level. But for a start these are the minimum requirement for your project at root level. Next let's look at the content of the src folder. Everything that carries a red marker in the capture above must be in place, exactly as shown for your project to be valid.
